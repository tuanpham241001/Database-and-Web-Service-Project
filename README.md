This is the code for our project in the course "Database and Web Services" offered by Jacobs University Bremen.

The project is about "Student Housing portal", where we model the website and database for student housing service. The website is connected with the database behind it, therefore students can use the tool to gain information about the room, college and mangaer, while the manager can maintain and edit the database with approriate credentials.

- Link to main website: http://clabsql.clamv.jacobs-university.de/~tpham (only accessible if you are..)

- Link to website with map: http://clabsql.clamv.jacobs-university.de/~tpham/map.php

Main language for Database: SQL 

Main language for Web Service: PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript

In the website, we have incorporated some advanced features: log-in paradigms for different users with different privildge (students do not need to login but they can only perform SEARCH. Manager has to log in to perform INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE), auto-complete feature, map contain your current location and IP, and access and error logging code
